# Question 'ab': Write not more than 250 words about 'cryptographic algorithm vulnerabilities (eg those faced by RC4)'
BEGIN:ab
Cryptographic algorithms are mathematical techniques that are used to protect important information in a network. The encryption algorithm encrypts and decrypts the information mathematically based on a secret key algorithm. This key must be kept secret, or the information could be compromised by anyone who knows it.  Rc4 is a cipher algorithm that implements a pseudo-random generator in software that uses SSL protocols. It has been declared a medium risk vulnerability by experts because it does not combine state data with key data during the initialisation phase of encryption properly. The issues emerged in the 1990’s and are difficult to detect, resolve and are often overlooked.  Hackers can use non-targeted passive attacks to exploit vulnerabilities by sniffing out SSL connections with rc4 encryption for weak key invariances to predict keystream LSB’s. They then use plain-text attacks against the first 100 bytes of data. The compromised date is then used in brutal attacks to recover sensitive information like credit cards and passwords.

# Question 'ac': Write not more than 250 words about 'digital signatures'
BEGIN:ac
Digital signatures are a type of electronic signature that use a mathematical scheme to validate a messages authenticity and integrity. Digital signatures are important because they create a unique digital identity to identify users and protect their data when being sent and received; they improve document management . Digital signatures are considered secure because they work using public infrastructure key pair system that encrypts and decrypts data for the signer and receiver; parties must have a registered digital certificate from an issuing certificate authority; it ensures the security, accuracy, and authenticity of data. Digital signatures work by using a mathematical algorithm that generates public and private keys. The signer has control over the private key which is then used to encrypt data. Once received the receiver uses the public key to decrypt data. The benefits of using digital signatures are that they save time for companies, reduce costs, improve document workflow efficiency, are secure, have legal validity in some countries, and reduce the environmental impact paper traditionally would have.

# Question 'ad': Write not more than 250 words about any of the items on the timeline at https://www.feistyduck.com/ssl-tls-and-pki-history/
BEGIN:ad
HTTP Strict Transport Security or HSTS is a transport layer mechanism that is designed to enforce the proper use of secure connections via HTTPS in the web browsers address header. HSTS was published and specified in the RFC 6797 in November 2012 and is a Internet engineering standard protocol that is used to secure web sessions instead of http. Websites do this by declaring https in the http in the response header field of a website and by other ways like User agent configuration settings. It is typically used over TCP, SSL and TLS transport protocols. HSTS aims to counter 3 types of network threats that http encountered. These are: passive network attacks like eaves dropping, active network attacks like man in the middle attacks and imperfect web developers. However, HSTS is still vulnerable to certain attacks. These are phishing: HSTS enables phishing defences by instructing the app to protect the session integrity and long-lived authentication tokens; And malware threats: HSTS is a browser security mechanism that relies on the systems integrity to protect the session. If the user’s system has malware, then the browser session can be compromised even if HSTS is being used.

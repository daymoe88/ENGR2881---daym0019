## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language performs the same function as write(), but without the possibility to set flags.
ab= false
# Question 'ac': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3, but not layer 4
ac= True
# Question 'ad': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language can be used to write data to a connection-oriented socket.
ad=True
# Question 'ae': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language allows setting the destination address when writing to connection-less sockets.
ae= True
# Question 'af': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language normally requires the network address, but not any layer 4 address of the target.
af= false
# Question 'ag': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language can be used to write out-of-band data to a socket.
ag= false
# Question 'ah': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language creates a network socket and binds it to a network address
ah= True
# Question 'ai': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language checks for newly received socket connections.
ai= false
# Question 'aj': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language requires a network address, to be able to create a socket.
aj= True
# Question 'ak': True or false: The listen() function for the C programming language causes a socket to actively connect via the network to listen for applications that require it.
ak= True
# Question 'al': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language closes a server's socket and all open connections created by that socket.
al= True
# Question 'am': True or false: The recv() function for the C programming language can only be used to read from UDP sockets
am= false
# Question 'an': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming language accepts all waiting network sockets each time it is called.
an= True
# Question 'ao': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language can be used to receive data from sockets.
ao= false
# Question 'ap': True or false: The read() function for the C programming language is the best choice for reading data from a UDP socket.
